## ABOUT US: 
While we always need more developers, Code for Baltimore welcomes designers, 
content creators, copywriters, storytellers, researchers, project managers, marketing 
specialists, and any other tech or government enthusiast!
 
We have two types of meetups: 
 * Hack Nights: project nights where our members work on 
   select projects to benefit Baltimore communities.
 * Community Nights: networking events with members of 
   the community and the group to discuss issues that could be solved with civic tech.
