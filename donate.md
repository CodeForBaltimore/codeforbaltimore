While not required by any means, we strongly encourage members to commit to a $5 monthly 
donation to support both Community and Hack Nights (snacks and drinks) along with other logistics 
(website management, Slack, etc.). We commit to being transparent about our finances, check them out [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15gDSzLBlnxXVBoo_pD55G8oTnr30B_GUs_07TbMDZAI/edit?usp=sharing).
