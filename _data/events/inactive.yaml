    Join us for a fun Hack Night to work on the projects with your team.
    Haven't previously joined us? That's ok! Teams are always growing and in need of people who want to dedicate some of their time to improving Baltimore through tech projects.
    Some of our current work includes hospital/health department emergency weather notifications, kinetic data sculptures, and the Idea Hub.
    We also love new ideas! Feel free to share anything you're working on or would like to explore.
